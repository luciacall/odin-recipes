    <h1>Sopinha do Macacinho by luli col</h1>
    <p>This recipe does take a couple of hours, mostly because you have to find one. You can also buy them on this site! <a href="">buymacacosonline.com</a></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 big onions</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove</li>
        <li>Juani's milk, 2 liters</li>
        <li>Any spicy condiments</li>
        <li>Three-year old macaco</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Previous steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>As we have discussed before, you need to find a monkey.
            <p>Three-year old ones are perfect for this. Their hair is still pretty thin, so it won't bother you as much when eating it. Plus, it's the perfect size for a domestic pot! </p>
        </li>
        <li>Give the monkey a good bath (<B>Pro tip! </B>Kill it before this step(HE COULD TRY TO KILL YOU)) <p>We have another recipe for unsanatized macacos. It gives them an extra flavor. You can check it <a href="here">here</a></p></li>
        <li>Skin the monkey <p>You can do this with a sharp knife. Take out <b>every single bit of his skin</b></p></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Let's get to work!</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Stir fry the onion</li>
        <li>Add the garlic clove, previously minced</li>
        <li>Cut macaco's skin so it would fit in the pot</li>
        <li>Add macaco's skin into the pot</li>
        <li>Add boiling water and spices <p>We have to leave still for about an hour</p></li>
        <li>Serve when macaco's hair are floating arround</li>
        <li><b>ENJOY!</b></li>
    </ul>
